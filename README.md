# Husqvarna Embroidery Cards
I own a husqvarna 1250 but this should also work with a husqvarna 1200. Fell free to improve or enhance this documentaiton!

## Basic information
The cards have a key on the left that encodes how five contacts inside of the machine are pushed. Each card can unlock up to 50 designs that are already stored on the machine. You can unlock them by simply pushing the right buttons, every card has a different code. You can easily find new codes on photos of the cards (e.g. on Ebay).

## How to recreate the cards
Right now I am working with cuppoard and a sissior, but I hope I will improve my approach over time.
