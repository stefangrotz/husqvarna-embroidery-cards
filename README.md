# husqvarna-embroidery-cards
I own a husqvarna 1250 but this should also work with a husqvarna 1200. Fell free to improve or enhance this documentaiton!

## Basic information
The cards have a key on the left that encodes how five contacts inside of the machine are pushed. Each card can unlock up to 50 designs that are already stored in the machine. You can unlock them by simply pushing the right buttons. You can easily see the codes on photos of the cards (e.g. Ebay).
